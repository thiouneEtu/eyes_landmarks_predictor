# eyes_landmarks_predictor

## Description of the project

In this project, we will learn how to train our own custom dlib shape eyes predictor. We’ll then learn how to take your trained dlib shape predictor and use it to predict eyes landmarks on input images.

Shape predictors, also called landmark predictors, are used to predict key (x, y)-coordinates of a given “shape”.

The most common, well-known shape predictor is dlib’s facial landmark predictor used to localize individual facial structures, including the:

-Eyes

-Eyebrows

-Nose

-Lips/mouth

-Jawline

Eyes landmarks are used for eyes alignment (a method to improve eyes recognition accuracy), building a “drowsiness detector”.

However, just because facial landmarks are the most popular type of shape predictor, doesn’t mean we can’t train a shape predictor to localize other shapes in an image!

To learn how to train your own dlib shape predictor, just see the code above !
